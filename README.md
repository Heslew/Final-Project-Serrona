# Final-Project-Serrona-COSC111B

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains all laboratory activities and exams for COSC 111B – CS Elective 3 (Internet of Things).
It showcases hands-on work with Arduino, Python, FastAPI, sensors, LEDs, and serial communication, from basic digital outputs to full IoT-style systems.

Final-Project-Serrona
 * Midterms

   
         Lab_Act_#1   # Digital signals, running light LEDs
         Lab_Act_#2   # Analog signals and PWM LED brightness
         Lab_Act_#3   # Sensor-based fire detection (thermistor + LDR)
         Lab_Act_#4   # Serial monitoring and control with photoresistor
         Midterms_Lab_Exam   # Smart lighting system with manual/auto modes
 * Finals
   
         Lab_Act_#5   # Python → Arduino serial LED control
         Lab_Act_#6   # Bidirectional Arduino–Python button/LED control
         Lab_Act_#7   # FastAPI + Arduino web-controlled LEDs
         Finals_Lab_Exam   # Arduino-to-Python client triggering remote LED API
* Each folder includes the source code and supporting files needed to run the corresponding activity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Common Files in Each Lab
  
        File / Asset	Description
        main.ino	Main Arduino sketch for the activity.
        main.py	Python script for serial/API interaction (when used).
        main_functions.h	Header file with reusable Arduino functions.
        breadboard_diagram.png	Wiring diagram or schematic for hardware setup.
        Not every lab uses all of these files; only the files relevant to that specific activity are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Tools & Technologies
  
        Arduino IDE for compiling and uploading sketches
        Python (with pyserial, requests, and FastAPI where applicable)
        Visual Studio Code or any preferred code editor
        Basic electronic components: LEDs, resistors, push buttons, thermistor, photoresistor, breadboard, jumper wires

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Notes
  
      Each lab is self-contained; files are intended to be used only within their own folder.
      Activities are organized into Midterms and Finals for easy navigation across the course timeline.
      The repository serves as a learning record and project portfolio, showing progression from basic Arduino I/O to integrated IoT-style systems with web APIs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* How to Use
  
      Open the specific lab folder you want to run.
      For Arduino-based activities, open main.ino in the Arduino IDE, select the correct board/port, and upload.
      For Python-enabled activities, install the required libraries, then run main.py from the appropriate folder.
      Follow breadboard_diagram.png (or equivalent diagram) for the correct hardware wiring.
