This laboratory activity introduces the use of sensor components commonly applied in IoT systems and demonstrates how multiple sensors can be integrated into a single Arduino-based circuit.

The activity implements a simple fire detection system using a thermistor and a photoresistor.

By combining temperature and light intensity readings, the system shows how environmental data can be processed to trigger hardware-based alerts.
